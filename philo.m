% lol and the cat next door
% boxing the range...get a value in a certain window...range/wsize
% see if the range box has any interesting frequency peak...perhaps with
% volume?
% there is probably no peak however...the range is probably just as random
% as the actual numbers.
% is forex random? if so, is it theoretically possible that technical
% analysis could ever be effective? 
% the forex market has certain properties as does any system, and can hence
% be predicted. but you never know what exactly will happen next, you just
% have a vague idea based on probability.
% the upl manager is next...how to stay in a winning trade and cut losing
% trades early? do winning trades share something in common that losing
% trades do not?
% get the mean upl of all winning and all losing trades...if price matches
% the losing trade, it should be cut.
